Environment
Device: iPhone 17 Pro
iOS: 26.x
Build path: Xcode run to physical device
iOS project type: Xcode project only (no xcworkspace, no CocoaPods)

Summary
The app icon does not render on the device after install/run from Xcode. The iOS asset catalog exists but the AppIcon set is incomplete and appears stale. Capacitor assets generation either writes to a different location than the Xcode target uses or is being overwritten by the project’s build/sync workflow. Replit needs to correct the icon pipeline so a complete AppIcon set is present in the actual iOS target asset catalog and is used by Xcode builds.

Evidence and current state

1. iOS project path in repo: `ios/App/App.xcodeproj` (no `Podfile`, no `Pods`, no `.xcworkspace`)
2. Asset catalog exists at: `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets`
3. AppIcon set exists at: `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset`
4. AppIcon set contents are incomplete and stale

   * Only one PNG present: `AppIcon-512@2x.png`
   * AppIcon files timestamped Jan 13, not updated by recent work
5. Source icons exist in repo and are correct sizes

   * `client/public/icon-1024.png`
   * `client/public/icon-512.png`
   * `client/public/icon-192.png`
6. Running `npx @capacitor/assets generate --ios` originally failed due to missing default asset directory, requiring `--asset-path`
7. After generating, the AppIcon set inside `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets` is still not updated and icon still does not render on device

Business impact

1. App Store submission readiness risk, including metadata and packaging requirements
2. Brand and user trust impact due to missing icon on home screen and app library
3. Wasted engineering and QA cycles due to inconsistent asset pipeline

Reproduction steps

1. Clone repo `HealthTrixssLLC/Pinochle-Pal`
2. npm install
3. npm run build
4. npx cap sync ios
5. Open `ios/App/App.xcodeproj` in Xcode
6. Run to physical device (iPhone 17 Pro iOS 26.x)
7. Observe app icon missing or not rendered correctly on the device

Attempted remediation steps and outcomes

1. Created local assets input folder and ran

   * `npx @capacitor/assets generate --ios --asset-path ./assets`
2. Confirmed Asset catalog exists, but AppIcon set remains unchanged and incomplete
3. Deleted app from device, cleaned build folder, cleared DerivedData, reinstalled
4. Icon still not rendering

Expected result

1. A complete iOS AppIcon set is generated and included in the build
2. The correct icon displays reliably on device after installation, across Home Screen, App Library, Spotlight, and Settings
3. Rebuild and resync does not revert icon assets to stale versions

Root cause hypotheses to investigate

1. `@capacitor/assets generate` is writing to a different AppIcon location than the Xcode target uses
2. A repo script or sync step overwrites `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets` with older assets (possible due to presence of `ios-setup/Assets.xcassets`)
3. Xcode target build settings are not pointing at `AppIcon` or asset catalog target membership is incorrect
4. Icon source image has an alpha channel or invalid properties causing iOS fallback behavior

Scope

1. Standardize the canonical icon source location in repo
2. Ensure `@capacitor/assets` writes into the actual Xcode target asset catalog used at build time
3. Ensure build and sync steps do not overwrite the generated AppIcon set
4. Ensure Xcode target references the correct AppIcon set name
5. Document the correct workflow for regenerating icons

Acceptance criteria

1. `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset` contains a complete set of required icon PNGs (not a single file) and a correct `Contents.json`
2. Running the documented icon generation command updates the AppIcon set timestamps and contents in the correct directory
3. Building and running to iPhone 17 Pro iOS 26.x displays the correct icon consistently
4. A clean uninstall/reinstall and device reboot does not cause the icon to disappear or revert
5. Rebuild and `npx cap sync ios` does not revert the icon to older assets
6. Documentation added to repo describing exact commands and source files to regenerate iOS icons

Deliverables

1. PR with changes to fix the icon pipeline and any scripts that overwrite assets
2. A short runbook in repo for icon generation and verification
3. Verification notes including on device test confirming icon rendering on iPhone 17 Pro iOS 26.x
